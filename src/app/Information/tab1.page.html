    <p>Why we concern only concern about carbohydrate      
      and fat?
      The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat   
      diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and 
      low-carb diets. It involves drastically reducing  
      carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat.

    <p>How to perform manual conversion on the food not   
      part of the dropdown list?
      Please first convert your food to 1 gram, and 
      then value how 1 gram of this type of food would             
      generate the amount of carbohydrate and fat in terms  
      of grams based on proportion. For instance, if 10 
      grams of such food generates 5.2 grams of 
      carbohydrate. Then 1 gram of the food would generate 
      0.52 grams of carbohydrate. To determine the  
      proportion, you need to divide 10 by the total food per  
      10g. 10g รท total food per 10g = 1 g food choice. Then 
      total carbohydrate per 5.2g รท total food per 10g = 0.52 
      g. Following such method would get you the desired 
      result.
